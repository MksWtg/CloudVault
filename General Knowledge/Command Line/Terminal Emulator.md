A terminal emulator mimics what a [[Terminal]] used to do- it provides a way to interface with the computer. However, it does not include dedicated hardware anymore. These days people use the word "terminal" to refer to a terminal emulator.

Examples include `conhost.exe` (which runs the `cmd.exe` shell), GNOME, terminator and alacritty.
