A shell is a program that lets you interact with your operating system using text commands.

It acts as a command interpreter: after a user types the command, the shell interprets it and the OS executes it. Then the result gets passed back and shown in the terminal.

Examples of shells are Bash, Zsh, `cmd.exe` and Powershell.

## Relationship Between Shell and Terminal

The shell runs inside the terminal. The terminal handles display, shell handles interpretation.
