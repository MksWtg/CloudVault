Functional Programming is a programming paradigm- it is an abstract set of principles, and if you can make an argument that your code abides by those principles, it is Functional code.

Some programming language mandate that these principles are followed. These languages are known as functional programming languages.

Languages that are considered functional are:
- Haskell ([[What is Haskell]])
- Lean
- Idris

Languages that are not strictly functional but have language features that enable functional code to be written are:
- Python
- C#
- Scala

## Principles of FP

- [[Immutable Data]]: Once a variable is assigned a value, that value cannot change and the variable cannot be reassigned.
- [[Functions Are First Class]]: Functions can be created and passed around as objects. Functions can take functions as arguments and return functions.
- [[Functions are Pure]]: Functions do not have side effects, AKA they do not mutate global state. Functions return results of computations instead. As a result, calling the same function twice will always return the same thing.
- Declarative: Code focuses on what to solve (expressions) rather than how to solve it (imperative statements)
