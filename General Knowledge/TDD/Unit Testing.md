Unit testing is a software testing technique where methods are tested in isolation. The 'test' is also a method that verifies the behaviour of the tested method. The goal is to verify that each small piece of functionality works correctly on its own. These tests are typically automated and written by developers.

## Purpose
The purpose of unit testing is to catch bugs early in development before they spread to other parts of the system. It improves code reliability, makes refactoring safer, and helps ensure that future changes do not break existing functionality. 

Typically every class has a test suite. A codebase may have dozens to millions of tests that run every time a developer is ready to check in new code. This is all done to ensure new code does not break old functionality.
