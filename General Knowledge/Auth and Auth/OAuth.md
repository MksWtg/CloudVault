OAuth (Open Authorization) is an authorization framework that allows a user to give a third-party application limited access to their resources without sharing their password.

## Example

If you click "Sign in with Google", you are redirected to google. You log in to google and when google asks "Do you allow this app to access your email address?" you click allow. Now the app gets an access token (not google password).

- This token is generated by the authorization server, like google or github or facebook
- The app uses the token to call the provider (google)'s API.
	- For example, the app requests to read your email, google asks you, you confirm, google generates a token the app can use as an api key to get some of your data from google
- The access token is proof that the user has granted this app permission to access certain resources. It replaces sharing passwords.

Access tokens are:
- Short-lived (minutes to hours)
- Scoped (limited permissions)
- Revocable
- Sometimes a JWT, sometimes opaque

These days, everyone uses OAuth 2.0 (OAuth 1.0 was released in 2010 and was difficult to implement. 2.0 is the standard.)
