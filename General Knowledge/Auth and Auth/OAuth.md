OAuth (Open Authorization) is an authorization framework that allows a user to give a third-party application limited access to their resources without sharing their password.

## Example

If you click "Sign in with Google”

You’re redirected to Google.
You log in there.
Google asks:

“Do you allow this app to access your email address?”

You click Allow.

The app now gets an access token, not your password.

That’s OAuth.
