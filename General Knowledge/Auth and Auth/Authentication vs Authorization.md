Authentication verifies identity. It answers "Are you really who you claim to be?". Logging in is an example of authorization, you claim to be a specific user e.g. `mukund` and the system verifies if this is true, e.g. by hashing the password and comparing it to the hashed password saved in the DB.

Authorization verifies permissions of an authenticated user. It comes after authentication. One user might be an admin and be allowed to delete users. Another user might be a customer, and they can only view their own orders.
