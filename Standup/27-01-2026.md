Before standup
1) Figured out what fix for [WI01020037 - Console - SAND console creates non-registered systems in orchestrated OU](https://ediprod.cw.wisetechglobal.com/link/ShowEditForm/WorkItem/61de15df-d124-49ff-9bf5-002379c939d7?lang=en-gb)
	1) The fix will be having an alert when a user in SAND or PROD console tries to create a new instance with service tasks (e.g. if they are testing winzor) to manually register the system, or else disable service tasks.
		1) May have to check what the window after creation before it is picked up by PCO.
	2) The affected instance was likely a console instance (judging by the name- starts with VQ for Victor since he may have made it). Since shelf tested instances (aka test rigs) are manually registered, this error would only show for test rigs if the instance was manually unregistered, which never happens.
2) Applied for SCOM access

After standup plan
1) Finish review for Michael regarding moving the proget feed
2) Write Doc Util functional testing plan and submit for review
3) Make change to alert in console FE and submit for review
4) Time recording

Time split:
1) 3: point 1
2) 6: point 2
3) 6: point 3
