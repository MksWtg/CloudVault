CargoWise Web Version is an update to CargoWise using the [[SUPPLY]] library making CW look like a sleek website rather than an outdated desktop app. It has made CW faster.

The old version, which at the time of writing most customers are still using, is referred to as the "RDP" version as it is served over [[RDP]]. The new version is served over the browser, over HTTPS, using a WebView to embed it into a C# wrapper application.
