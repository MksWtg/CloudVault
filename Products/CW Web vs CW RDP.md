CargoWise Web Version is an update to CargoWise using the [[SUPPLY]] library making CW look like a sleek website rather than an outdated desktop app. It is faster.

delivers the same familiar look and feel as the Remote Desktop version but is built on modern web technology. It offers a faster, more secure user experience, improved integration with GLOW portals, and a stronger technical foundation to support future CargoWise enhancements.
