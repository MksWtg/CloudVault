Prerequisites: [[CW Web vs CW RDP]], [[Cw1 vs CwNext]]

**TL;DR: they are TWO SEPARATE THINGS**

CW Web and CW Next are both improvements made to cargowise.

CW Web changed the app from one that was accessed via RDP to one that was accessed via HTTPS.

CW Next is a change to the cargowise UI to make it look new and sleek. 

They are separate things, and you can have CW instances that are one but not another. But generally, because CWNext came before CWWeb, it is unlikely customers will be using CW Web and not CW Next.
